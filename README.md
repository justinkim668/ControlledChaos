Non-Newtonian Temporal Narratives in Media.

# Installation/Use
Software requirements are outlined in requirements.txt.

1. Download this GitHub repository.
2. On Terminal/Command Line, navigate to the folder for this repository on your local machine.  Run "python -m venv .venv".  Do NOT navigate away from this folder.
3. On Terminal/Command Line, run "pip install -r requirements.txt".
5. Go to wide_time_chaotic.py and change the input and output file names.
7. On Terminal/Command Line, run "python wide_time_chaotic.py".

# Future Work
Future work will focus on the following:
1. Optimize Logistic Map code for $O(N)$ time.
2. Port this Python logic over to GLSL fragment shaders.
3. Extend this logic to higher-dimensional chaotic maps like the Lorenz System.
